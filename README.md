Compilation of Gene Analysis Algorithms for hopefully some useful Machine Learning application later.

This is a GUI based application that will perform the algorithms implemented in the software.

### Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm
This algorithm is used primarily for gene sequencing looking for the optimal match between multiple gene sequences. For a physical and interactive understanding of the software used you can go to http://experiments.mostafa.io/public/needleman-wunsch/. It is a very interesting algorithm and I would suggest you check it out.
