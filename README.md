# GeneAnalysisProgramming
Compilation of Gene Analysis Algorithms for hopefully some useful Machine Learning application later.

# Gene Ally
This is a GUI based application that will perform the algorithms implemented in the software.

### Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm
This algorithm is used primarily for gene sequencing looking for the optimal match between multiple gene sequences. For a physical and interactive understanding of the software used you can go to http://experiments.mostafa.io/public/needleman-wunsch/. It is a very interesting algorithm and I would suggest you check it out.

### Cytogenic Location
This program will implement the Cytogenic Location which is a technique for finding where specific genes will be located by giving the chromosome, arm, region and band. 7q31.2, for example, would be the CFTR gene located on the 7th chromosome's long arm, in the 3rd region on the 1st band, and the 2nd sub-band.
